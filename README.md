# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases the creation of **comprehensive HR Analytics dashboards** using **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**, along with **SQL-based KPI validation**.  
It replicates real-world analytics workflows where insights are verified across multiple tools to ensure accuracy, reliability, and data consistency.

## 🏢 Problem Statement
The HR department faced challenges such as:
- Lack of defined KPIs to evaluate workforce health and performance  
- Difficulty tracking attrition, demographics, and satisfaction levels  
- Absence of unified dashboards for management-level decision-making  

This project addresses these issues by delivering **interactive dashboards** and **data validation queries** that enable data-driven HR insights.

## 🎯 Key KPIs Implemented
- **Employee Count** – Total number of employees in the organization  
- **Attrition Count** – Employees who left the organization  
- **Attrition Rate (%)** – Ratio of employees leaving vs. total workforce  
- **Active Employees** – Count of currently active employees  
- **Average Age** – Average employee age for demographic analysis

## 📈 Dashboard Requirements
The dashboards visualize HR data across different perspectives:
1. **Attrition by Gender** – Gender-based attrition comparison  
2. **Department-wise Attrition** – Identify departments with higher turnover  
3. **Employees by Age Group** – Analyze workforce demographics  
4. **Job Satisfaction Ratings** – Measure employee engagement  
5. **Attrition by Education Field** – Track education-based attrition trends  
6. **Attrition by Gender & Age Group** – Combined insights for retention strategies
